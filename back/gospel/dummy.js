You will be given at that moment what you are to say.\n[[Mt 10,20]]For it will not be you who speak but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.\n[[Mt 10,21]]Brother will hand over brother to death, and the father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.\n[[Mt 10,22]]You will be hated by all because of my name, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.\"",
