For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons.\n[[Lc 11,19]]If I, then, drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges.\n[[Lc 11,20]]But if it is by the finger of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\n[[Lc 11,21]]When a strong man fully armed guards his palace, his possessions are safe.\n[[Lc 11,22]]But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.\n[[Lc 11,23]]Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.\"\n[[Lc 11,24]]When an unclean spirit goes out of someone, it roams through arid regions searching for rest but, finding none, it says, 'I shall return to my home from which I came.'\n[[Lc 11,25]]But upon returning, it finds it swept clean and put in order.\n[[Lc 11,26]]Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than itself who move in and dwell there, and the last condition of that person is worse than the first.\"",
